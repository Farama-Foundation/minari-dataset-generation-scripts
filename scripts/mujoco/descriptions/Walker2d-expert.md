The data is collected from the [Walker2d](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/walker2d/) environment. The Agent was trained with [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)'s implementation of `SAC` for $25 \cdot 10^6$ steps. This "expert" policy runs with a wide gait very fast, while falling rarely.
