The data is collected from the `[HalfCheetah](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/half_cheetah/)` environment. The Agent was trained with `Stable Baselines 3`'s implementation of `TQC` for $6 \cdot 10^6$ steps. This "medium" policy runs fast, in a natural looking motion, while never falling over.
