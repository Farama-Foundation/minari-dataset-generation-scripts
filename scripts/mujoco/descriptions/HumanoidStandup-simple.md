The data is collected from the [HumanoidStandup](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/humanoid_standup/) environment. The Agent was trained with [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)'s implementation of `SAC` for $2 \cdot 10^6$ steps, without the `cinert`, `cvel`, `qfcr_actuator`, `cfrc_ext` observations. This "simple" policy stands up to an unstable position and then falls over.
