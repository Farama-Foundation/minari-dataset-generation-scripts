The data is collected from the `[Hopper](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/hopper/)` environment. The Agent was trained with `Stable Baselines 3`'s implementation of `SAC` for $25 \cdot 10^6$ steps. This "expert" policy hops very fast, in a natural looking motion, while remaining upright.
