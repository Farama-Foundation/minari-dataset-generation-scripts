The data is collected from the [Hopper](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/hopper/) environment. The Agent was trained with [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)'s implementation of `SAC` for $25 \cdot 10^6$ steps. This "expert" policy hops very fast, in a natural looking motion, while remaining upright.
