The data is collected from the `[InvertedDoublePendulum](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_double_pendulum/)` environment. The Agent was trained with `Stable Baselines 3`'s implementation of `SAC` for $50 \cdot 10^3$ steps. This "medium" policy is able to stay balanced sometimes.
