The data is collected from the `[Swimmer](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/swimmer/)` environment. The Agent was trained with `Stable Baselines 3`'s implementation of `XXX` for $100 \cdot 10^6$ steps with a learning rate of $\gamma = 1$ because of ["Making reinforcement learning work on swimmer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07587). This "expert" policy performs a serpentine motion.
