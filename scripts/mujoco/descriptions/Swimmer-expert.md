The data is collected from the [Swimmer](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/swimmer/) environment. The Agent was trained with [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)'s implementation of `PPO` for $100 \cdot 10^6$ steps with a learning rate of $\gamma = 1$ because of ["Making reinforcement learning work on swimmer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07587). This "expert" policy moves fast with a serpentine motion.

TODO: Is this correct??
