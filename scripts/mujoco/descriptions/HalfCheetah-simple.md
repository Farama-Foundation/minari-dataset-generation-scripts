The data is collected from the [HalfCheetah](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/half_cheetah/) environment. The Agent was trained with [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)'s implementation of `TQC` for $10^6$ steps. This "simple" policy runs with decent speed and never falls over frequently.
