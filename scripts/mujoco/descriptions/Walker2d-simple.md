The data is collected from the [Walker2d](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/walker2d/) environment. The Agent was trained with [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)'s implementation of `SAC` for $1.5 \cdot 10^6$ steps. This "simple" policy walks with a decend speed, in a natural looking motion, while remaining upright.
